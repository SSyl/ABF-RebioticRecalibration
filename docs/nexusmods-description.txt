[size=6][b][center]Rebiotic Recalibration[/center][/b][/size]
A UE4SS Lua mod that bundles quality-of-life tweaks, visual enhancements, and bug fixes into a single configurable package. No more guessing which containers your distribution pad can reach, no more squinting at dark crafting previews, and no more cracked food displays ruining your kitchen aesthetic.

Every feature can be toggled on or off. Enable what you want, disable what you don't. Disabled features have zero performance cost - they don't register hooks or run any logic.

[size=3][b]Features[/b][/size]

All of these features can be toggled on or off and the vast majority of them have additional options. Don't like something about it or wish it could be customized? Chances are, there's a customization option for it. If there's not, leave a comment and it may be something I can add.

[size=3][b]Heads Up (UE4SS)[/b][/size]

This mod runs on UE4SS, which can occasionally crash during game startup or world load. Once you're in-game, it's typically stable. See Known Issues below for details.

[size=3][b]Requirements[/b][/size]

[list]
[*]UE4SS — Recommended: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35]NexusMods release for Abiotic Factor[/url] (Oct 2025). Other builds may work but are experimental.
[*]Abiotic Factor (tested on v1.2 Holiday Cryosphere Update)
[/list]

[size=3][b]Installation[/b][/size]

[list=1]
[*]Install UE4SS if you haven't already from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35]Nexus Mods[/url]
[*]Download and extract to [code][...]Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64[/code]
[*]Folder structure should be: [code]Mods\RebioticRecalibration\scripts\main.lua[/code]
[/list]

[b]Verify it works:[/b] On game launch, check [b]UE4SS.log[/b] for "[Rebiotic Recalibration] MOD LOADING"

[b]To uninstall:[/b] Delete the Mods/RebioticRecalibration/ folder.
[b]To temporarily disable:[/b] Rename or delete the [b]enabled.txt[/b] file in the mod folder. (The mod ships with this file; if it's missing, create an empty [b]enabled.txt[/b] to enable.)

[size=3][b]Configuration[/b][/size]

On first run, the mod automatically generates [b]config.lua[/b] in the mod folder. Edit this file to enable/disable features and adjust settings. The file is commented with descriptions and default values.

When the mod updates with new options, your existing config is automatically patched - your settings are preserved and only missing options are added.

For custom icons (Distribution Pad Indicators, Custom Server Button), see [b]icon-list.txt[/b] in the mod folder for available icon names.

Example:
[code]
AmmoCounter = {
    Enabled = true,
    LoadedAmmoWarning = 0.5,  -- Yellow at 50% capacity
},

LowHealthVignette = {
    Enabled = true,
    Threshold = 0.25,  -- Trigger at 25% health
},
[/code]

Changes take effect on game restart.

[size=3][b]Multiplayer[/b][/size]

All features work client-side in multiplayer. The following features require the host to have the mod installed and [b]only work in peer-to-peer (player-hosted) games, not dedicated servers[/b]:

[list]
[*][b]Distribution Pad Range[/b]
[*][b]Beds Keep Spawn[/b]
[*][b]Vehicle Light Toggle[/b]
[/list]
Dedicated server support is being explored, but the modding approach used here doesn't currently work on dedicated servers.

[b]Food Display Fix[/b] works slightly differently: if only you have the mod installed, it fixes the visual for you. If the host has the mod installed, it fixes it for everyone.

[size=3][b]Known Issues & Workarounds[/b][/size]

[b]Intermittent UE4SS startup crashes (~10% of launches)[/b]

This can occur during startup or world loading due to UE4SS injection timing and may vary by UE4SS version and other installed mods. It's not specific to this mod. Once you're in-world, stability is typically solid.

Workaround: Restart the game.

[b]Mod conflicts[/b]

May conflict with other UE4SS mods that hook the same widgets or HUD elements. If you experience issues or crashes with multiple mods installed, try disabling overlapping features in [b]config.lua[/b] or disabling other mods to isolate the conflict.

[size=3][b]Reporting Issues[/b][/size]

When reporting issues, please include: UE4SS version, game version, other installed UE4SS mods, and [b]UE4SS.log[/b]

[size=3][b]FAQ[/b][/size]

[b]Why UE4SS instead of a .pak mod?[/b]
I have more experience with programming than with Unreal Engine Editor. UE4SS lets me write Lua code to hook into the game at runtime, which fits my skillset better.

[b]Why bundle everything instead of separate mods?[/b]
Many features share the same hooks internally. Bundling them reduces overhead in UE4SS compared to having multiple separate mods register the same hooks independently. If you use more than a couple features, this approach is more performant. That said, if there's enough demand to split off specific features into standalone mods, I'm open to it.

[b]Will unused or disabled features hurt my performance?[/b]
No. Features check their config on startup. If disabled, they don't register any hooks or run any logic - zero performance cost. You can safely leave the whole mod installed and pick and choose what you want or don't want.

[b]How do I edit the config? I can't find config.lua![/b]
The config file is automatically generated on first run. Launch the game once with the mod installed, then look for [b]config.lua[/b] in the mod folder (Mods\RebioticRecalibration\config.lua). If it's still missing, check that the mod loaded successfully by looking for "[Rebiotic Recalibration] MOD LOADING" in UE4SS.log. You can also find the latest default config in the Optional Files section for reference.

[b]Why isn't Distribution Pad Range / Bed "Just Sleep" / Vehicle Light Toggle working?[/b]
These features require the host to have the mod installed. If you're playing on a dedicated server, these features won't work - they only work in peer-to-peer (player-hosted) games. See the Multiplayer section above for details.
