[size=6][b][center]Rebiotic Recalibration[/center][/b][/size]
A UE4SS Lua mod that bundles quality-of-life tweaks, visual enhancements, and bug fixes into a single configurable package. No more guessing which containers your distribution pad can reach, no more squinting at dark crafting previews, and no more cracked food displays ruining your kitchen aesthetic.

Every feature can be toggled on or off. Enable what you want, disable what you don't. Disabled features have zero performance cost - they don't register hooks or run any logic.

[size=3][b]Features[/b][/size]

[b]Gameplay[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Distribution Pad Indicators[/b] - Shows an icon next to containers within range of a distribution pad. Customize icon, color, size, position - or use text instead

[*][b]Vehicle Light Toggle[/b] - Adds interaction to toggle headlights on SUV, Forklift, and Security Cart

[*][b]Beds Keep Spawn[/b] - Tap interact on beds to sleep without changing your respawn point
[*][b]Player Tracker[/b] - Outline other players, like the Employee Locator trinket but without NPC tracking (off by default)
[*][b]Auto Jump-Crouch[/b] - Automatically crouch mid-jump for extra height. Configurable delay, hold vs tap to crouch, auto-uncrouch on landing. Helpful for controller users (off by default)

[/list]
All of these features can be toggled on or off and the vast majority of them have additional options. Don't like something about it or wish it could be customized? Chances are, there's a customization option for it. If there's not, leave a comment and it may be something I can add.

[size=3][b]Heads Up (UE4SS)[/b][/size]

This mod runs on UE4SS, which can occasionally crash during game startup or world load. Once you're in-game, it's typically stable. See Known Issues below for details.

[size=3][b]Requirements[/b][/size]

[list]
[*]UE4SS — Recommended: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35]NexusMods release for Abiotic Factor[/url] (Oct 2025). Other builds may work but are experimental.
[*]Abiotic Factor (tested on v1.2 Holiday Cryosphere Update)
[/list]

[size=3][b]Installation[/b][/size]

[list=1]
[*]Install UE4SS if you haven't already from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/abioticfactor/mods/35]Nexus Mods[/url]
[*]Download and extract to [code][...]Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64[/code]
[*]Folder structure should be: [code]Mods\RebioticRecalibration\scripts\main.lua[/code]
[/list]

[b]Verify it works:[/b] On game launch, check UE4SS.log for [code][Rebiotic Recalibration] MOD LOADING[/code]

[b]To uninstall:[/b] Delete the [code]Mods/RebioticRecalibration/[/code] folder.
[b]To temporarily disable:[/b] Rename or delete the [code]enabled.txt[/code] file in the mod folder. (The mod ships with this file; if it's missing, create an empty [code]enabled.txt[/code] to enable.)

[size=3][b]Configuration[/b][/size]

Edit [code]config.lua[/code] to enable/disable features and adjust settings. The file is commented with descriptions and default values.

For custom icons (Distribution Pad Indicators, Custom Server Button), see [code]icon-list.txt[/code] in the mod folder for available icon names.

Example:
[code]
AmmoCounter = {
    Enabled = true,
    LoadedAmmoWarning = 0.5,  -- Yellow at 50% capacity
},

LowHealthVignette = {
    Enabled = true,
    Threshold = 0.25,  -- Trigger at 25% health
},
[/code]

Changes take effect on game restart.

[size=3][b]Multiplayer[/b][/size]

All features tested and work client-side in multiplayer with two caveats:

[list]
[*][b]Food Display Fix[/b] - If the host has it enabled, the fix applies to all players. If only a client has it enabled, the fix only visually applies for them.
[*][b]Distribution Pad Range[/b] - Host only (server-authoritative).
[/list]
The mod has not been tested on dedicated servers, but those two should be the only features requiring server-side installation.

[size=3][b]Known Issues & Workarounds[/b][/size]

[b]Intermittent UE4SS startup crashes (~10% of launches)[/b]

This can occur during startup or world loading due to UE4SS injection timing and may vary by UE4SS version and other installed mods. It's not specific to this mod. Once you're in-world, stability is typically solid.

Workaround: Restart the game.

[b]Mod conflicts[/b]

May conflict with other UE4SS mods that hook the same widgets or HUD elements. If you experience issues or crashes with multiple mods installed, try disabling overlapping features in config.lua or disabling other mods to isolate the conflict.

[size=3][b]Reporting Issues[/b][/size]

When reporting issues, please include: UE4SS version, game version, other installed UE4SS mods, and [code]UE4SS.log[/code]

[size=3][b]FAQ[/b][/size]

[b]Why UE4SS instead of a .pak mod?[/b]
I have more experience with programming than with Unreal Engine Editor. UE4SS lets me write Lua code to hook into the game at runtime, which fits my skillset better.

[b]Why bundle everything instead of separate mods?[/b]
Many features share the same hooks internally. Bundling them reduces overhead in UE4SS compared to having multiple separate mods register the same hooks independently. If you use more than a couple features, this approach is more performant. That said, if there's enough demand to split off specific features into standalone mods, I'm open to it.

[b]Will unused or disabled features hurt my performance?[/b]
No. Features check their config on startup. If disabled, they don't register any hooks or run any logic - zero performance cost. You can safely leave the whole mod installed and pick and choose what you want or don't want.
